# The Nym Platform

Nym is a privacy platform. It provides strong network-level privacy against sophisticated end-to-end attackers, and anonymous access control using blinded, re-randomizable, decentralized credentials.

Our goal is to allow developers to build new applications, or upgrade existing apps, with privacy features unavailable in other systems.
