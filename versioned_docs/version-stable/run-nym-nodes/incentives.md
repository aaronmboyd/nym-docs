We will get into building the Nym codebase and running nodes in the next section. Before we do so, a note on token incentives.

The Nym network has some of the same overall goals as [Tor](https://tor-project.org). But we want to enable Nym to scale in response to increased demand (and shrink when demand drops, so as not to waste resources). To do this in a decentralized way, nodes are included in the network based on cryptocurrency bonding, and a system of delegated staking.

Sandbox is not incentivized but it includes `NYMT` test-tokens designed to mimic the tokenomics of the Nym mainnet. `NYMT`s have no real world utility but node operators or delegators will receive `NYMT`s to see how the economics, reward sharing and other mechanisms of the Nym mainnet works.

:::caution
Testnet rewards may not exactly reflect how the incentives structure work on mainnet but they will be very close to it!

### Joining the Sandbox Testnet as a participant of Milhon 
Existing members of the Milhon testnet will be automatically moved over to Sandbox when it launches, as will the balances of their wallets and nodes. These balances are based on a snapshot taken at 15:00 UDT 20th December 2021.  

### Joining the Sandbox Testnet as a new participant 
There is a `NYMT` faucet [here](https://faucet.nymtech.net/). These tokens can be used to bond nodes and delegate to existing Sandbox nodes.  

:::caution
If for any reason you lose your mnemonic, the tokens held in your account are lost, and they will **not** be able to be returned to you.
