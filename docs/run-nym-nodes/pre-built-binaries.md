# Pre-built Binaries

The Nym [release page](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases) has pre-built binaries which _should_ work on Ubuntu 20.04 and other Debian-based systems, but at this stage cannot be guaranteed to work everywhere.

Later, when we're focused more on things like packaging, we will ensure that all components get built for all operating systems. There is a third-party install script which can be found [here](https://github.com/gyrusdentatus/nym_autoinstall), although this may not always be up to date with the newest version of the testnet.

If the pre-built binaries don't work or are unavailable for your system, you will need to build the platform yourself.
