We will get into building the Nym codebase and running nodes in the next section. Before we do so, a note on token incentives.

The Nym network has some of the same overall goals as [Tor](https://tor-project.org). But we want to enable Nym to scale in response to increased demand (and shrink when demand drops, so as not to waste resources). To do this in a decentralized way, nodes are included in the network based on cryptocurrency bonding, and a system of delegated staking.

We are now testing out the incentives structure for running Nym nodes in our permanent testnet, Nym-Sandbox. For the Sandbox testnet, Nym testnet wallet holders who run nodes or delegate stake to nodes will receive (valueless) testnet tokens, `NYMT`, which runs on our Cosmos-based blockchain validators.

:::caution
Testnet rewards may not reflect how the incentives structure will work on mainnet!

### Joining the Sandbox Testnet as a participant of Milhon 
Existing members of the Milhon testnet will be automatically moved over to Sandbox when it launches, as will the balances of their wallets and nodes. These balances will be based on a snapshot taken in January 2022, which will be published online.  

### Joining the Sandbox Testnet as a new participant 
There will be a faucet available soon which can be used to request `NYMT` for using in the testnet. There will be updates on this soon - watch this space! 

:::caution
If for any reason you lose your mnemonic, the tokens held in your account are lost, and they will **not** be able to be returned to you.
