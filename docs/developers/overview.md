If you are a coder, we invite you to build privacy enhanced applications - **PEAPs** - using Nym.

There are many different ways of utilising the anonymity properties the Nym mixnet and its associated technologies such as coconut offer developers, and numerous levels of the stack at which to start developing: 

* Mixnet apps
* Hack on infrastructure
* Nyx blockchain 
* Integrations with existing apps 

## Mixnet 
Nym lets you build privacy respecting clients and services which use our network infrastructure. Your apps can then connect to other apps also using the Nym network. All app-to-app communication happens over a set of cooperating networked nodes called a mixnet.

Mixnets give strong privacy guarantees against third-party observers.

It is apparent to any external network adversary that a given machine has connected to Nym infrastructure. Beyond that, it should not be possible to infer what activity is taking place unless there are observable network side effects (i.e. a Service Provider that makes network requests on behalf of a Nym client).

Since the network has only just reached the level that users can start to build meaninful applications on top of it, there's not much in the way of guides or how tos yet - these will be coming in the immediate future, so keep your eyes peeled! 
				
## Hack on nodes
If you're wanting to develop on top of the infrastructure code itself, and start adding additional features to existing nodes, check out the Nym github repo! If you want to get to grips with running a node before starting this, check out the 'node operators' section of these docs for more.  

## Nyx Blockchain
If you want to start by looking at the smart contract level, look towards Nyx [here], and also have a look at our `validator-api` code if you want to hack on that
